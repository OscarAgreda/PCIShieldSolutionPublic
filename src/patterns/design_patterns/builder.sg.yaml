# This rule matches Builder pattern implementations like:
# - CustomerBuilder with Build() method
# - InvoiceBuilder with Build() method
#
# The $CLASS placeholder will match the class name being built
# The $RETURN_TYPE placeholder will match the return type of Build()
# The $$$ placeholders will match any other code in the class
