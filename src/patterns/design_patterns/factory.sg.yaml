# This rule matches Factory pattern implementations like:
# - CustomerFactory with Create methods
# - InvoiceFactory with Create methods
#
# The $NAME placeholder will match the factory name
# The $RETURN_TYPE placeholder will match the return type of the Create method
# The $$$ placeholders will match any other code in the class
